# TURN OFF YOUR ANTIVIRUS
# TURN OFF YOUR ANTIVIRUS
# TURN OFF YOUR ANTIVIRUS
# Why?
The reason why we ask you to turn off your Anti-Virus is to prevent your anti-virus from deleting the cheat program as the cheat program is flaged for injection of another game. Every/almost every cheat program is flaged for this vary reason and we ask you to turn it off.
# PASSWORD: 1234
# Why do you have a password?
We have a password so the program doesn't get deleted by your anti-virus, because I personally know how much of a irritation that is when your in a middle of the game yet you almost win and your cheat program get deleted then you lose.
